# ARpoNDB

This is a public data from the project of https://biocomputo.ibt.unam.mx/arpondb/. 

This repository contains the code and data for the study **"Analysis and Comparison of the Bacterial σ54 Regulon: Evidence of Phylogenetic Trends in Gene Regulation."** The project provides a comprehensive analysis of σ54 binding sites across diverse bacterial species, uncovering evolutionary trends in gene regulation.

## Features:

- Identification of σ54 regulons using a custom computational method
- Phylogenetic comparison of σ54-dependent genes
- Visualization and statistical analysis of regulon distribution
- Scripts for reproducible data processing.
  - The R script used to calculate COG overrepresentation 








The web server is up and running, and the data is easily accessible.
